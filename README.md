### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jack

I'm a 22 year old software developer with 4 years of varied experience accross the whole pipeline thanks to following an apprenticeship straight from school. From front-end to back-end to devops to Linux to NoSQL graph databases to relational databases, I've touched on a lot! My main language is Java so right now I am focussing on full stack web development with an emphasis on learning more about Spring Boot and back-end API development. But I have a keen interest in developing my already existing Python skills going forward. 

(I also have a short stint in Product Management so you can be sure I have a keen eye for developing a product the correct way!)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web application to allow users to track and rank their favourite movies of all time with an alert for when they are showing in cinemas nearby to them! This will be full stack web application build with Spring Boot!
